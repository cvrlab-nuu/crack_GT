# crack_GT
The dataset of generated ground truths 

This repo is the dataset of the GTs that are produced by our algorithm (presented in the paper titled "Automated Ground Truth Generation for Learning-Based Crack Detection on Concrete Surfaces."

Download the dataset via https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1D0TS0dx-haFcyIZPJDQ4FM7ddxvfutAW?usp=sharing

There are three zip files. 

(1) images.zip (the original crack images of concrete surfaces)

(2) first_round_GT (the first-round GTs labled by our algorithm for the original images)

(3) second_round_GT ((the second-round GTs labled by our algorithm for the original images)

The GTs are marked by 1 or 0, which denote crack and non-crack classes, respectively.
